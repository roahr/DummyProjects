# Virtual Control 

This repository contains Python scripts for hand gesture control applications using computer vision techniques. 

1. `virtual_mouse.py`: This script enables controlling the mouse cursor and simulating clicks using hand gestures detected by the webcam.
2. `volume_control.py`: This script allows controlling system volume levels by measuring the distance between thumb and index finger tips captured by the webcam.

### Functionality:

- **Virtual Mouse:**
  - Detects hand gestures to control the mouse cursor movements and simulate mouse clicks.
  - Provides real-time feedback with hand landmarks overlayed on the camera feed.
  - Supports exiting the program with the 'q' key.

- **Volume Control:**
  - Utilizes hand gestures to adjust system volume levels.
  - Displays the current volume level with a visual indicator on the camera feed.
  - Supports exiting the program with the 'q' key.

### Usage:

1. **Setup:**
   - Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed (see `requirements.txt`).

2. **Running the Scripts:**
   - Execute the desired script in a Python environment.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the applications.
   - Press the 'q' key to exit the programs.

3. **Adjustments:**
   - Experiment with different hand gestures and thresholds for optimal control experience.
   - Customize the scripts according to specific hardware configurations and preferences.
